# mpdtrackr
## Track your [mpd](https://www.musicpd.org/) listening time locally on a per artist and per song basis.
### Command line application I made because I prefer using mpd for music but got jealous of all the spotify people who got to see what they listened to the most.
Still fairly scuffed since I haven't learned how to work with threads and this is my first rust project that isn't just copying a coreutil.
